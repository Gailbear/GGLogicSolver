GGLogicSolver
=============

Attempting to make a grid-style logic problem solver using MIT's Alloy and python.

to use solve.py in another file:
from solve import solve

and then solve(puzzleObject) will return the solution (if there is one!)

or you can save the implementation inside a file called LLImpl.py and name the puzzle object puzzle, and then `python solve.py` will solve it.
